# 🧠 AI Technology Analysis & Autonomous Search-and-Rescue Drone

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a critical, evidence-based analysis of cutting-edge multimodal AI systems — including CLIP, Flamingo, BLIP-2, LLaVA, and MiniGPT-4 — evaluating their architecture, technical evolution, societal implications, and ethical challenges.

Additionally, the project includes an AI system design analysis of an **Autonomous Search-and-Rescue Drone**, applying intelligent agent theory and the PEAS framework to model autonomous decision-making in disaster environments.
